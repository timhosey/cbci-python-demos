# CloudBees CI Python Demos

## Purpose
This repo is intended for me to dabble in Python scripts to execute
specific actions within a CloudBees CI instance.

## Files
`get_jobs_by_last_run.py` - This script will list jobs by their last
run timestamp, output as minutes since. Useful for determining activity
on a controller.
